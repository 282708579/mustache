rtemplate
=========

Inspired by [ctemplate](http://code.google.com/p/google-ctemplate/)
and
[et](http://www.ivan.fomichev.name/2008/05/erlang-template-engine-prototype.html),
rtemplate is a framework agnostic way to render your views.

It's not a markup language because there is no language. There is no
logic. Only structure.
